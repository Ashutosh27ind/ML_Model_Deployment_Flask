# ML_Model_Deployment_Flask
Deploy a Machine Learning models in production as APIs(Flask)

This project demonstrates use of Flask web framework for model deployment.  
  
FLASK is a python web framework that allows to build REST based API services quickly with minimum configuration and hassle.  
Its build around Werkzeug and Jinja.  

## Problem Statement :
We use the telecom churn prediction problem for showcasing the deployment. The output of the model is either 0(Not Churn) or 1(Churn).
We would follow the machine learning pipeline for this. The steps followed are as follows:

Data Acquisition
Data Pre-Processing
Feature Engineering
Train the Model
Save the Model
Create an API using Flask
Test API in Postman
Create a Webpage and test the application

How to run the application ?

Option 1 : Through the web page (preferred for users):
  1.1 Run : python app.py
  1.2 Open the local host server URL running in browser
  1.3 Input the required features and click on predict button to get the the ouput as churn or not
  
Option 2 : Through the
